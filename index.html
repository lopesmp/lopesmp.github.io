   <div class="summary"> <p>Fruits Basket tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after meeting Yuki,
       Kyo, and Shigure Soma, learns that twelve members of the Soma family are possessed by the animals of the 
       Chinese zodiac and are cursed to turn into their animal forms when they are weak, stressed, or 
       when they are embraced by anyone of the opposite sex that is not possessed by a zodiacal spirit.

    <p>As the series progresses, Tohru learns of the hardships and pain faced by the afflicted Somas, and through
       her own generous and loving nature, helps heal their emotional wounds. As she learns more about Yuki, Kyo, 
       and the rest of the mysterious Soma family, Tohru also learns more about herself and how much others care for her.
